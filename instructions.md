# Flatiron Software Engineering Curriculum Interview Homework

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a `README.md` file. This is a historical
snapshot of a lesson that introduces students to the concept of `self` in Ruby.

The `README.md` needs to be revised to teach the learning objectives in Python
rather than Ruby. Please make edits to improve the content and translate the
syntax of the example code to Python.

You can assume that students working on this lesson are familiar with the
`class` keyword, instance attributes, and instance methods.

If you're unfamiliar with Ruby's syntax, the
[Learn X in Y minutes guide](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/) is a
helpful resource.

## Getting Started

Please clone (don't fork) this repository, and use a text editor of your choice
to update the `README.md` file. Use `git` to commit your changes. We'll be using
`git diff` and similar tools to see what you changed.

## Time Commitment

You should plan on spending no more than 2 hours on this assignment. While there
are many possible edits, prioritize your edits so that we can see how you
sequence edits, what stylistic changes you might make, and what your approach to
explaining the learning goals is.

## Guidelines

First and foremost, your focus should be on ensuring the lesson teaches the
following learning goals in Python:

- Understand the concept of self-awareness in object-oriented programming
- Understand how the `self` keyword works

You may also make other edits to improve the content and fix any
grammatical/stylistic issues with the lesson, and ensure that the formatting is
consistent throughout.

## Submitting

To submit, please push your code to a **private** GitHub repository and share it
with the GitHub user [ihollander](https://github.com/ihollander).
